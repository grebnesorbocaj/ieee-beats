## Setup and Instructions
Let's get started! Make sure you meet the Requirements above first then continue below.

Go to https://github.com/ieee-utd/ieee-beats/wiki to get started!

## Running the App
You'll need two terminal windows to run the app.

1. Run `node app.js` inside the `api` folder.
2. Run `polymer serve --port 8000` inide the `ui` folder.

Then, go to `localhost:8000` in your web browser. You should see a very basic site!

To verify the API is working, go to `localhost:5000/api` in your web browser.
